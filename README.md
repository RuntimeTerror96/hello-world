# hello-world
First GitHub repository.


Waddup nerds,

I've been programming for a little over a year (C/C++) and I'm interested in learning the ways of GitHub.
I think it would be really cool to contribute to some projects and maybe create some of my own in the future.
That's about it, welcome to my first GitHub repository.
